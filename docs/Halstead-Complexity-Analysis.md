# Halstead Complexity Analysis

> Halstead's goal was to identify measurable properties of software, and the relations between them. This is similar to the identification of measurable properties of matter (like the volume, mass, and pressure of a gas) and the relationships between them (analogous to the gas equation). Thus his metrics are actually not just complexity metrics.

## Result Interpretation

It is up to you how to interpret the results, the Halstead metrics are probably even more controversial than the cognitive complexity metrics.
